# Cross platform packaging notes
#
# By default, we package the proto area from the same architecture as
# the packaging build.  In other words, if you're running nightly or
# bldenv on an x86 platform, it will take objects from the x86 proto
# area and use them to create x86 repositories.
#
# If you want to create repositories for an architecture that's
# different from $(uname -p), you do so by setting PKGMACH in your
# build environment.
#
# For this to work correctly, the following must all happen:
#
#   1. You need the desired proto area, which you can get either by
#      doing a gatekeeper-style build with the -U option to
#      nightly(1), or by using rsync.  If you don't do this, you will
#      get packaging failures building all packages, because pkgsend
#      is unable to find the required binaries.
#   2. You need the desired tools proto area, which you can get in the
#      same ways as the normal proto area.  If you don't do this, you
#      will get packaging failures building SUNWonbld, because pkgsend is
#      unable to find the tools binaries.
#   3. You need to have built the appropriate third party license
#      files in $SRC, which generally means you should override SRC in
#      your build environment.  If you don't do this, you will get
#      packaging failures because pkgsend is unable to find various
#      THIRDPARTYLICENSE files.
#   4. The remainder of this Makefile should never refer directly to
#      $(MACH).  Instead, $(PKGMACH) should be used whenever an
#      architecture-specific path or token is needed.  If this is done
#      incorrectly, then packaging will fail, and you will see the
#      value of $(uname -p) instead of the value of $(PKGMACH) in the
#      commands that fail.
#   5. Each time a rule in this Makefile invokes $(MAKE), it should
#      pass PKGMACH=$(PKGMACH) explicitly on the command line.  If
#      this is done incorrectly, then packaging will fail, and you
#      will see the value of $(uname -p) instead of the value of
#      $(PKGMACH) in the commands that fail.
#
# Refer also to the convenience targets defined later in this

# For a single manifest, the dependency chain looks like this:

#		| use pkgmogrify to process raw manifest
#		|
#	processed manifest (mypkg.mog)
#		|
#	   *    | use pkgdepend generate to generate dependencies
#		|
#	manifest with TBD dependencies (mypkg.dep)
#		|
#	   %    | use pkgdepend resolve to resolve dependencies
#		|
#	manifest with dependencies resolved (mypkg.res)
#		|
#		| use pkgsend to publish the package
#		|
#	placeholder to indicate successful publication (mypkg.pub)
#	
# * This may be suppressed via SUPPRESSPKGDEP.  The resulting
#   packages will install correctly, but care must be taken to
#   install all dependencies, because pkg will not have the input
#   it needs to determine this automatically.
#
# % This is included in this diagram to make the picture complete, but
#   this is a point of synchronization in the build process.
#   Dependency resolution is actually done once on the entire set of
#   manifests, not on a per-package basis.
#
# The full dependency chain for generating everything that needs to be
# published, without actually publishing it, looks like this:
#
#	processed synthetic packages
#		|		|
#       package lists	    synthetic package manifests
#		|
#	processed real packages
#	    |		|
#	package dir	real package manifests
#
# Here, each item is a set of real or synthetic packages.  For this
# portion of the build, no reference is made to the proto area.  It is
# therefore suitable for the "all" target, as opposed to "install."
#
# Since each of these steps is expressed explicitly, "all" need only
# depend on the head of the chain.
#
# From the end of manifest processing, the publication dependency
# chain looks like this:
#
#		repository metadata (catalogs and search indices)
#			|
#			| pkg.depotd
#			|
#		published packages
#		 |		|
#		 |		| pkgsend publish
#		 |		|
#	  repositories 	    resolved dependencies
#		 |			|
# pkgsend	 |			| pkgdepend resolve
# create-repository	 	 	|
#		 |		generated dependencies
#	 repo directories		|
#					| pkgdepend
#					|
#				processed manifests
#
# Due to limitations in pkgdepend, we cannot simply treat synthetic
# and real manifests identically.  But we don't really want to
# maintain a separate chain for synthetic manifests, so for the left
# side of this diagram, we actually do faux dependency generation and
# resolution, so we end up with the expected set of files in $(PDIR),
# per the individual file chain described above: mf, mog, dep, res,
# and pub files for each manifest.

#
# rule to process real manifests
#
# To allow redistributability and package status to change, we must
# remove not only the actual build target (the processed manifest), but
# also the incidental ones (the metadata-derived symlinks).
#
# If pkgmogrify exits cleanly but fails to create the specified output
# file, it means that it encountered an abort directive.  That means
# that this package should not be published for this particular build
# environment.  Since we can't prune such packages from $(PKGS)
# retroactively, we need to create an empty target file to keep make
# from trying to rebuild it every time.  For these empty targets, we
# do not create metadata symlinks.
#
# Automatic dependency resolution to files is also done at this phase of
# processing.  The skipped packages are skipped due to existing bugs
# in pkgdepend.
#
# The incorporation dependency is tricky: it needs to go into all
# current and renamed manifests (ie all incorporated packages), but we
# don't know which those are until after we run pkgmogrify.  So
# instead of expressing it as a transform, we tack it on ex post facto.
#
# Implementation notes:
#
# - The first $(RM) must not match other manifests, or we'll run into
#   race conditions with parallel manifest processing.
#
# - The make macros [ie $(MACRO)] are evaluated when the makefile is
#   read in, and will result in a fixed, macro-expanded rule for each
#   target enumerated in $(PROC_PKGS).
#
# - The shell variables (ie $$VAR) are assigned on the fly, as the rule
#   is executed.  The results may only be referenced in the shell in
#   which they are assigned, so from the perspective of make, all code
#   that needs these variables needs to be part of the same line of
#   code.  Hence the use of command separators and line continuation
#   characters.
#
# - The extract_metadata transforms are designed to spit out shell
#   variable assignments to stdout.  Those are published to the
#   .vars temporary files, and then used as input to the eval
#   statement.  This is done in stages specifically so that pkgmogrify
#   can signal failure if the manifest has a syntactic or other error.
#   The eval statement should begin with the default values, and the
#   output from pkgmogrify (if any) should be in the form of a
#   variable assignment to override those defaults.
#
# - When this rule completes execution, it must leave an updated
#   target file ($@) in place, or make will reprocess the package
#   every time it encounters it as a dependency.  Hence the "touch"
#   statement to ensure that the target is created, even when
#   pkgmogrify encounters an abort in the publish transforms.  This
#   will not cause publication failures when switching build
#   environments, because $(CLOSED_BUILD) and $(OPEN_ONLY) are
#   referenced in $(PKGMOG_DEFINES), and changes will therefore
#   trigger a rebuild for command dependency failure.  (Command
#   dependency checking is turned on by .KEEP_STATE: above.)

# This is a convenience target to allow package names to function as

# development of a manifest.
#
# When processing a manifest, use the basename (without extension) of
# the package.  When publishing, use the basename with a ".pub"
# extension.
#
# Other than during manifest development, the preferred usage is to
# avoid these targets and override PKGS on the make command line and
# use the provided all and install targets.
